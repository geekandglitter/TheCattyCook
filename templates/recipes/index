<p><b>If you're a cook</b>
Use this interface to my recipe blog. The links in bold will be most useful to you.
Find what you want, click through, and you can even print the recipes!</p>

<p><b>If you're a developer</b>
 
I'm both a cook and a nerd. I wrote this Python/Django web app to experiment with scraping, RSS Feeds and API's. Those are three different
ways to get content from a website or blog. Its concept is that it serves as a front end to allow various ways to 
find recipes in my blogspot recipe blog, <a href="https://thecattycook.blogspot.com/">The Catty Cook</a>. Each link here
represents a Django view.   </p>

<h1>Select any link below and have fun!</h1>

    <li><b><a href="/searchedinput">Type in any word(s) that might be in a recipe, separated by commas</b> 
    </a><br><small>Shows results in order of relevance, which is based on number of criteria met.
     This view uses Blogger API, Django Models and ModelForm.

     the post urls from three RSS feeds, then store them each in one record in a model. It does not use Google Blogger API.
